Raven for Ruby is a client and integration layer for the GlitchTip error reporting API. It supports Ruby 1.9.3 and 2.x. JRuby support is provided but experimental.

## Installation

Raven Ruby comes as a gem and is straightforward to install. If you are using Bundler, add this to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "sentry-raven"
```

<!-- For other means of installation see [_Installation_]({%- link _documentation/clients/ruby/install.md -%}). -->

## Configuration

To use Raven Ruby all you need is your DSN. Like most Sentry-compatible libraries, it will honor the `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable. You can find it on the project settings page under API Keys. You can either export it as environment variable or manually configure it with `Raven.configure`:

```ruby
Raven.configure do |config|
  config.dsn = 'YOUR-GLITCHTIP-DSN-HERE'
end
```

## Reporting Failures

If you use Rails, Rake, Sidekiq, etc, youâ€™re already done - no more configuration required!

Raven supports two methods of capturing exceptions:

```ruby
Raven.capture do
  # capture any exceptions which happen during execution of this block
  1 / 0
end

begin
  1 / 0
rescue ZeroDivisionError => exception
  Raven.capture_exception(exception)
end
```

You can add either of the snippets above into your application to verify that GlitchTip is set up correctly.
