GlitchTip recommends using [@micro-sentry/angular](https://gitlab.com/glitchtip/micro-sentry). Alternatively, users who need performance data need to use `@sentry/angular-ivy`.

# @micro-sentry

@micro-sentry features a very small bundle size and is easy to configure.

Install `@micro-sentry/angular`:

```bash
$ npm install --save @micro-sentry/angular
```

In `app.module.ts` add MicroSentryModule with your GlitchTip DSN.

```javascript
import { MicroSentryModule } from '@micro-sentry/angular';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    MicroSentryModule.forRoot({
      dsn: "YOUR-GLITCHTIP-DSN-HERE",
    }),
  ],
})
```

## Configuration

- dsn - Where to send event data too, found in GlitchTip in project settings.
- environment - Set the running environment name, such as "production". When running in Node, such as Angular Universal, this defaults to environment variable `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT`. No default is used in browser.
- release - Set release name such as "1.0". Required to make use of uploaded sourcemaps.
- ignoreErrors
- blacklistUrls

```javascript
    MicroSentryModule.forRoot({
      dsn: "YOUR-GLITCHTIP-DSN-HERE",
      environment: "production",
      release: "1.0.0"
    }),
```

# @sentry/angular-ivy

@sentry/angular-ivy has more features including performance tracking. The package adds up to [277 KB](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=@sentry/angular-ivy) to your JS bundle size.

Install `@sentry/angular-ivy`:

```bash
$ npm install --save @sentry/angular-ivy
```

For best results, add this snippet to your main.ts. If you need to set the DSN dynamically, you may set this elsewhere as well.

```javascript
import { init } from "@sentry/angular-ivy";

init({
  dsn: "YOUR-GLITCHTIP-DSN-HERE",
  autoSessionTracking: false,
});
```

## Configuration

A more robust configuration example:

```javascript
import { init } from '@sentry/angular-ivy';

.init({
  dsn: "YOUR-GLITCHTIP-DSN-HERE",
  environment: "production",
  release: "1.0.0",
  autoSessionTracking: false,
  tracesSampleRate: 0.01,
});
```

- dsn - Where to send event data too, found in GlitchTip in project settings.
- release - Set release name such as "1.0". Defaults to environment variable `SENTRY_RELEASE`.
- environment - Set the running environment name, such as "production". When running in Node, such as Angular Universal, this defaults to environment variable `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT`. No default is used in browser.
- sampleRate - Percent of error events to send to GlitchTip. 0.5 would be 50%. Defaults to 1.0.
- tracesSampleRate - Percent of performance transactions to send to GlitchTip. 0.01 would be 1%. We recommend a lower value to save costs/hard drive space.

### Performance Monitoring

It's possible to send performance transactions to GlitchTip.

Install `@sentry/tracing`

Add integration to SDK configuration:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "GlitchTip DSN",
  integrations: [
    new Integrations.BrowserTracing({
      tracingOrigins: ["localhost", "https://example.com"],
      routingInstrumentation: Sentry.routingInstrumentation,
    }),
  ],
  // Capture 1% of transactions
  tracesSampleRate: 0.01,
});
```

### Show user feedback dialog

Provide a custom Angular ErrorHandler. In your root modules file, adjust providers:

```javascript
providers: [
  {
    provide: ErrorHandler,
    useValue: Sentry.createErrorHandler({
      showDialog: true,
    }),
  },
],
```
