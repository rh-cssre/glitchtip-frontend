It is recommended to use an integration for your particular WSGI framework if available, as those are easier to use and capture more useful information.

If you use a WSGI framework not directly supported by the SDK, or wrote a raw WSGI app, you can use this generic WSGI middleware. It captures errors and attaches a basic amount of information for incoming requests.

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.wsgi import SentryWsgiMiddleware

from myapp import wsgi_app

sentry_sdk.init(dsn="YOUR-GLITCHTIP-DSN-HERE")

wsgi_app = SentryWsgiMiddleware(wsgi_app)
```
